## Context for Next Agent

The project is implementing a new documentation/workflow system called "CHATFLOW v2.0":
- Master hub: `.agent/AGENT.md`
- Session state: This file (`docs/chatflow/TASK_CURRENT.md`)
- See `docs/chatflow/TASK_BACKLOG.md` for planned work

The SQLite migration branch is still active but the migration itself is complete and tested.
