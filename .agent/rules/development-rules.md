# Framerr Development Rules

**CRITICAL: These rules are IMMUTABLE and MUST be followed by all AI agents working on Framerr.**

---

##  RULE 1: Always Test After Code Changes

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING - Agent MUST NOT proceed without passing build

- After ANY file edit, MUST run `npm run build`
- Build MUST pass before proceeding to next change
- If build fails  MUST restore from git immediately using `git checkout -- .`
- NEVER commit code that doesn't build
- NEVER skip this step "to save time"

**Workflow Integration:** 
- `/end-session` requires final build verification
- `/build-develop` requires passing build before Docker

---

##  RULE 2: View Before Edit

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING - Agent MUST view file before editing

- MUST use `view_file` or `view_file_outline` before ANY edit
- MUST understand context of specific file, as well as any related files or systems that may be affected, before making changes
- MUST understand current systems in place to avoid duplicate, conflicting, or otherwise unnecessary functionality when creating or editing systems 
- NEVER edit files blindly
- NEVER assume file structure without viewing

**Exceptions:** NONE

---

##  RULE 3: Small, Precise Edits

**Enforcement:** ADVISORY - Agent should follow unless technically impossible

- Edit ONE function or block at a time
- NEVER replace entire files unless absolutely necessary
- Use targeted `replace_file_content` calls
- Keep changes reviewable and reversible
- Multiple small commits > One large commit

**Rationale:** Easier to debug, review, and revert if needed

---

##  RULE 4: Checkpoint Protocol (CRITICAL)

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING - Agent MUST execute checkpoints

- Execute `/checkpoint` workflow at tool calls #10, #20, #30, etc.
- Re-read `docs/tasks/HANDOFF.md` CRITICAL CONTEXT section at each checkpoint
- Verify context alignment with current task
- Update `docs/tasks/TASK_CURRENT.md` regularly
- If tool calls >= 80  MUST strongly recommend `/end-session` to user
- If tool calls >= 100  MUST alert user and insist on session end

**Workflow Integration:**
- `/checkpoint` is auto-triggered every 10 tool calls
- Prevents context drift
- Maintains session quality

---

##  RULE 5: Git Discipline

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING for corruption, ADVISORY for commits

- Check for file corruption before committing:
  - Unusually large file sizes
  - Syntax errors
  - Build failures
- If corruption detected  MUST alert user, MUST NOT commit
- MUST NOT proceed with Docker deployment if corruption exists
- Use descriptive commit messages: `feat:`, `fix:`, `chore:`
- Auto-commit after successful changes (when clean)

**Corruption Detection:**
- Files >10MB (unexpected for this project)
- Changes shows + and - many more lines than expected
- Build errors after edit
- Syntax errors reported by IDE

---

##  RULE 6: Documentation Updates

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING for session end, ADVISORY during work

- Update `docs/tasks/TASK_CURRENT.md` after completing subtasks
- Update `docs/tasks/HANDOFF.md` when making architectural changes
- Update `docs/tasks/STATUS.md` at session end (via `/end-session`)
- NEVER let documentation fall out of sync with code

**Workflow Integration:**
- `/end-session` REQUIRES documentation updates
- `/checkpoint` verifies documentation is current

---

##  RULE 7: Session Start/End Protocol

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING

### Session Start (MUST USE `/start-session`)
- MUST invoke `/start-session` at beginning of work
- MUST read `docs/tasks/HANDOFF.md` CRITICAL CONTEXT first
- MUST check for "SESSION END" marker in `docs/tasks/TASK_CURRENT.md`
- If no marker  MUST invoke `/recover-session`
- MUST initialize checkpoint counter to 0

### Session End (MUST USE `/end-session`)
- MUST invoke `/end-session` when wrapping up
- MUST add explicit session end marker to `docs/tasks/TASK_CURRENT.md`
- MUST update all documentation before marking session end
- MUST run final `npm run build` verification

**Workflow Integration:**
- Ensures clean handoffs between sessions
- Prevents work loss or confusion

---

##  RULE 8: Logging Standards

**Enforcement:** ADVISORY for new code, BLOCKING for centralized logging changes

- Use centralized logger:
  - Frontend: `src/utils/logger.js`
  - Backend: `server/utils/logger.js`
- NEVER use raw `console.log` in production code
- Respect LOG_LEVEL environment variable
- Use appropriate levels: ERROR, WARN, INFO, DEBUG
- NEVER log sensitive data (tokens, passwords, API keys)

**Exception:** Development/debugging (must remove before commit)

**Reference:** See `docs/development/LOGGING_REFERENCE.md`

---

##  RULE 9: Deployment Safety

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING

### Before Deployment
- Build MUST pass
- NO corrupted files
- User MUST approve Docker deployments
- User MUST confirm production releases

### Workflow Usage
- Use `/build-develop` for development deployments
- Use `/build-production` for production releases
- NEVER deploy without workflow
- NEVER deploy manually without user approval

### Version Control
- Production releases MUST have git tags
- MUST update `package.json` version
- MUST update `CHANGELOG.md`

---

##  RULE 10: File Corruption Prevention

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING

### Detection
Agent MUST check for:
- File sizes >10MB (unusual for this project)
- Syntax errors after edits
- Build failures
- IDE error reports

### Response
If corruption detected:
1. MUST alert user immediately
2. MUST NOT commit corrupted files
3. MUST NOT proceed with deployment
4. MUST restore from git: `git checkout -- [file]`
5. MUST NOT try to "fix forward"

**Rationale:** Clean slate safer than risky repairs

---

##  RULE 11: User Approval Required

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING

Agent MUST get user approval for:
- Docker deployments (develop or production)
- Production version numbers
- Breaking changes
- File deletions
- Risky operations (database changes, etc.)

Agent MUST NOT:
- Auto-deploy without confirmation
- Make assumptions about version numbers
- Delete files without verification

---

##  RULE 12: Context Maintenance

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING at checkpoints

### At Every Checkpoint
Agent MUST answer these questions:
1. What is the current task?
2. What was the last thing completed?
3. What should I do next?
4. Are there any blockers?
5. What files am I working on?

If ANY answer is uncertain  MUST re-read full `docs/tasks/HANDOFF.md` + ask user

### If Context Drift Detected
1. MUST stop current work
2. MUST re-read `docs/tasks/HANDOFF.md` fully
3. MUST re-read `docs/tasks/TASK_CURRENT.md`
4. MUST ask user for clarification
5. MUST reset checkpoint counter

---

##  RULE 13: Emergency Procedures

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING when invoked

### Session Crashed
- MUST invoke `/recover-session`
- MUST check git status
- MUST verify build status
- MUST ask user for recovery direction
- NEVER auto-delete uncommitted work

### Build Failures
1. MUST stop immediately
2. MUST restore from git
3. MUST identify failing change
4. MUST fix before proceeding
5. MUST test incrementally

---

##  RULE 14: Theming System Compliance (MANDATORY)

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING - Agent MUST follow theming rules when creating/editing UI

### Required Actions

**Before creating/editing ANY UI component:**
1. Read `.agent/rules/theming-rules.md` (MANDATORY)
2. Read `docs/theming/DEVELOPER_GUIDE.md` (if exists)
3. Use ONLY theme utilities (`.bg-theme-primary`, `.text-theme-secondary`, etc.)
4. Test in Light theme BEFORE committing
5. Test with flatten UI enabled

### Absolute Prohibitions
-  NEVER use hardcoded Tailwind colors (`text-white`, `bg-slate-900`, etc.)
-  NEVER use hardcoded hex/RGB colors (`#3b82f6`, `rgb(59,130,246)`, etc.)
-  NEVER mix theme and non-theme classes

### Testing Checklist (BLOCKING)
- [ ] Tested in Light theme
- [ ] Tested with flatten UI enabled  
- [ ] No hardcoded colors (run grep checks)
- [ ] Build passes

**Full Details**: See `.agent/rules/theming-rules.md`

---

##  NEVER DO THIS (Absolute Prohibitions)

**Enforcement:** BLOCKING - These actions are FORBIDDEN

1.  Edit files without viewing them first
2.  Commit without running `npm run build`
3.  Deploy Docker without user confirmation
4.  Skip checkpoint protocol
5.  Edit multiple files in parallel blindly
6.  Replace entire files when small edits suffice
7.  Commit corrupted files
8.  Continue past 80 tool calls without recommending `/end-session`
9.  Make breaking changes without user approval
10.  Use raw `console.log` instead of centralized logger (in production)
11.  Deploy with build failures
12.  Work without invoking `/start-session` first
13.  End work without invoking `/end-session`
14.  Proceed when context is unclear
15.  **Create/edit UI without reading theming documentation**
16.  **Use hardcoded colors (Tailwind classes, hex, RGB) in UI components**
17.  **Commit UI code without testing in Light theme**
18.  **Skip flatten UI testing for components using glassmorphism**

---

##  Rule Enforcement Levels

### BLOCKING
- Agent MUST NOT proceed if rule is violated
- System should prevent action
- User intervention required to override

### ADVISORY
- Agent SHOULD follow rule unless technically impossible
- Agent should explain if deviating
- User can override more easily

---
