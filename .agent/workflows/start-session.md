# /start-session

## Steps

1. **Read system hub**
   ```
   Read .agent/AGENT.md
   ```
   - Understand file map
   - Know task type requirements
   - Know prohibited behaviors

2. **Read session state**
   ```
   Read docs/chatflow/TASK_CURRENT.md
   ```
   - Find SESSION END marker
   - Know where last session ended
   - Know what the next step is

3. **Identify task type from user request**
   - UI work → read `docs/reference/theming.md`
   - Architecture work → read `docs/reference/architecture.md`
   - Widget work → read `docs/reference/widgets.md`
   - If doc doesn't exist → ask user before proceeding

4. **Summarize to user**
   - Where we left off
   - What they want to do now
   - What reference docs I read (if applicable)
   - Ready to plan (await approval before executing)
