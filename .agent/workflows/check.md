# /check

## When to Use

User invokes this when they notice:
- Agent seems off-track
- Agent making assumptions
- Agent not following rules
- General drift concerns

---

## Steps

1. **Re-read core files**
   ```
   Read .agent/AGENT.md
   Read docs/chatflow/TASK_CURRENT.md
   ```

2. **Report current state**
   - What I think I'm working on
   - What TASK_CURRENT.md says I should be doing
   - Any mismatch detected

3. **Self-check**
   - Have I been following the rules?
   - Did I read required reference docs?
   - Have I been using proper file editing (not CLI)?
   - Am I asking when uncertain?

4. **Correct course if needed**
   - Acknowledge any issues found
   - State corrective action
   - Resume with proper alignment
